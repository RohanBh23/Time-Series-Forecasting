XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems.

XGBoost gained significant favor in the last few years as a result of helping individuals and teams win virtually every Kaggle structured data competition. In these competitions, companies and researchers post data after which statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the data.
For complexity and high dimension data, XGBoost performs works better than Adaboost because XGBoost have system optimizations.

XGBoost incorporates additional regularization terms in its objective function to control the complexity of the model, thereby helping to avoid overfitting. The objective function in XGBoost consists of two main parts: the training loss and the regularization term.

1. **Training Loss (L(training))**: The training loss measures how well the model fits the training data. It quantifies the discrepancy between the actual target values and the predicted values generated by the model. XGBoost supports various loss functions depending on the type of problem being solved (e.g., regression, classification). For regression tasks, commonly used loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), while for classification tasks, it could be logistic loss or softmax loss.

2. **Regularization Term (Ω(f))**: The regularization term controls the complexity of the individual trees in the ensemble, preventing them from becoming overly complex and fitting noise in the data. This term helps to generalize the model better to unseen data and avoid overfitting.

   The regularization term in XGBoost can be written as the sum of two parts:

   a. **Tree Complexity Regularization**: This part of the regularization term penalizes the complexity of individual trees in the ensemble. It is calculated as the sum of the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms applied to the leaf weights of each tree.
   
   The L1 regularization term penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the leaf weights, while the L2 regularization term penalizes the sum of the squares of the leaf weights. This helps in simplifying the trees by encouraging smaller leaf weights, effectively pruning the trees and reducing their complexity.
   
   Mathematically, the tree complexity regularization term (Ω(f)) can be written as:
   
   $$Ω(f) = γ * T + ½ * λ * Σ(w²)$$

   Where:
   - T is the number of leaves in the tree.
   - γ is the regularization parameter controlling the impact of the number of leaves.
   - λ is the regularization parameter controlling the impact of the leaf weights.
   - w is the weight of each leaf node.

   b. **Regularization on the Number of Trees**: In addition to penalizing the complexity of individual trees, XGBoost also includes a term that penalizes the number of trees (K) in the ensemble. This term helps control the overall complexity of the model and prevent it from becoming overly complex.
   
   Mathematically, the regularization term on the number of trees can be written as:
   
   $$Ω(K) = η * K$$

   Where:
   - η is the regularization parameter controlling the impact of the number of trees.

The overall objective function in XGBoost is the sum of the training loss and the regularization term:

$$Objective = L(training) + Ω(f) + Ω(K)$$

By optimizing this objective function during training, XGBoost finds the optimal ensemble of trees that balances between minimizing the training loss and controlling the complexity of the model, thus avoiding overfitting. Adjusting the regularization parameters (γ, λ, and η) allows fine-tuning the model's complexity to achieve better generalization performance on unseen data.


### Data Description:
The dataset used in this code represents restaurant order data. Each row contains information about a particular order, including the order number, timestamp, item ordered, quantity, price, and total products in the cart. Additionally, the data includes a 'label' column, which likely represents a target variable, possibly the number of orders.

### Problem Statement:
The problem addressed in this code is time-series forecasting of restaurant order volumes. The goal is to predict the future number of orders based on historical data. This prediction can help restaurant owners and managers make informed decisions about inventory management, staffing, and other operational aspects.

### Approach Overview:
1. **XGBoost Regression Approach**:
   - This approach utilizes the XGBoost library, which is a popular gradient boosting framework. The problem is formulated as a regression task where historical order counts are used to predict future order volumes.
   - Features such as 'order_count_7_day' and 'order_count_30_day' are engineered to capture the recent and long-term order trends.
   - XGBoost regressor is trained on the engineered features to learn the relationship between past order volumes and future predictions.

2. **Prophet Approach**:
   - Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is particularly well-suited for time-series data with strong seasonal patterns.
   - This approach involves training Prophet models iteratively, with each iteration predicting the order volume for the next week.
   - The predictions are then aggregated and visualized to understand how well the model captures the underlying order trends.

### Methods:

1. **XGBoost Regression Approach**:
   - The XGBoost algorithm minimizes the following objective function for regression tasks:
     \[ \text{Objective} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{loss}(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Omega(f_k) \]
     where:
     - \( \text{loss}(y_i, \hat{y}_i) \) represents the loss function, typically the mean squared error for regression problems.
     - \( \Omega(f_k) \) is the regularization term that penalizes the complexity of the model to prevent overfitting.
     - \( f_k \) represents the \( k \)-th tree in the ensemble model.
   
2. **Prophet Approach**:
   - Prophet models the time series using a generalized additive model (GAM) framework. The forecast equation is:
     \[ y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \varepsilon_t \]
     where:
     - \( g(t) \) represents the trend component, which captures the long-term growth or decline in the time series.
     - \( s(t) \) represents the seasonal component, which captures periodic fluctuations in the data.
     - \( h(t) \) represents the holiday effects, accounting for the impact of holidays or special events on the time series.
     - \( \varepsilon_t \) is the error term, representing random noise or unmodeled variability.

### Code Explanation:

1. **XGBoost Regression Approach**:
   - The code first loads and preprocesses the dataset, extracting relevant features like 'order_count_7_day' and 'order_count_30_day'.
   - It splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - XGBoost regressor is initialized and trained on the training data using the `fit()` method.
   - The trained model is then used to make predictions on the testing data using the `predict()` method.
   - Finally, the predictions are visualized alongside the actual order counts using seaborn.

2. **Prophet Approach**:
   - The code prepares the data for Prophet by renaming columns and converting timestamps.
   - It iterates over each point in time, fitting a Prophet model and making predictions for the next week.
   - The predictions are aggregated, and the process continues until the end of the dataset.
   - The predictions are then visualized alongside the actual order counts using seaborn.

By comparing the performance of both approaches, stakeholders can gain insights into the underlying order trends and make informed decisions about resource allocation and operational planning.

### Libraries Used:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **seaborn** and **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **XGBoost**: For implementing the XGBoost regression approach.
- **Prophet**: For implementing the time-series forecasting approach.
